      "The pandemic was a huge turn in my life. I had discovered Naval Ravikanth, which was the butterfly to a <b>storm of finance, entrepreneurship & self-help books</b> . I have always been intrigued by wealth, but the pandemic that gave rise to extra time, more knowledge consisely connected the dots on what I exactly needed to do. I became very clear on what I had to do next. A new chapter of wealth creation begins. <br /> <br /> I joined Workllama as an Android Engineer, and learnt how to architect apps at scale. Conducted 50+ interviews, coded 5+ libraries. Learnt how to build & ship applications using Next js, React, Tailwind, Node js, Docker and more! Hunted several <b>product of the day</b> ProductHunt posts. I had previously been shying away from learning new technologies, but I couldn't stop here! The more I read about economy, the more I understood the nuances of society.",

      'I had scored an Android internship with huge efforts. I picked Android because I had seen the boom of Whatsapp and the irrepeclable value proposition it offers, and its arguably monopolistic status. Despite getting placed with many MNCs at my college, it was time to take control of my life. When you say the words <b>Bengaluru, Tech or Startups</b> my brain strarted lighting up. I was born in a generation inspired by The Social Network, so it was a no brainer to be the underdog. I had interned at Bolkar (previously Pascolan) a startup aiming to be the #1 Indian vernacular audio Q&A platform. <br/><br/> While the movie potrayals of startups are extremely glamorous, the reality can hurt a bit. I had started to code only in the later parts of college, and it meant work on Saturday Nights at 1 AM. The pain soon numbed and what emerged was a developer who could now suddenly write design libraries. Bolkar was a part of <b>Axilor Ventures</b> - An Startup Accelator that hosted not only us, but 13 more top-tier teams. This made me interact with several founders who had already been successful in their past, graduating from IITs and IIMs. ',
